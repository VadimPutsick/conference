Many of us also have been, or will eventually be, affected by factors such as the increased use of new machine translation approaches, changing patent translation requirements, or downturns in the economy of our source and/or target countries. In this session, the panelists will discuss how their client bases, specializations, and working language pairs have evolved throughout their careers.",
